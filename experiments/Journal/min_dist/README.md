# Minimum Distance Ergodic Search

This is our subfolder dedicated to the minimum distance ergodic search optimization problem. While also used for the Time Optimal Ergodic Search Paper[^1], this is also a final project for Professor Daniel Rakita's CPSC 485 Applied Planning and Optimization class.

The problem setup and solver are in `build_solver.py`, and the main file to run to perform the optimization is `render_bias_search.py`.
